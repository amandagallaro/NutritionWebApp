# NutriPhoria
A Personalized Nutrition Web Application
NutriPhoria is an individual development program of a Full Stack Web Application. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a user to manually enter their personal information such as Name, Age, Gender, Height and Weight, for the program to calculate their unique BMI and suggested serving sizes for each food group. Further, I created a physical and mental survey for each user to fill out, resulting in a brief description of sample foods to improve their potential physical and/or mental symptoms. I then provided links to online websites to purchase the suggested foods as an efficient and cost effective way to introduce in their newly found diet. 

Languages and Techniques used to deploy my application:
Front-End: Written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, with AJAX  and jQuery implementation and techniques
Middleware: Node.js platform with Express framework
Back-End: MySQL Database development

Future Improvements: 
The server is run globally.
To gain access with online shopping companies for the user to quickly purchase their suggested foods at the lowest price possible.
